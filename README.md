# Gid - Get It Done!

### Simple self-contained and selfhosted todo or task manager.
This is a *really* simple ToDo (or task) manager built with PHP, jQuery and Bootstrap.

This is what it looks like.

#### Why?
I was looking for a ToDo or task manager that was:
1. Self hosted
2. Self contained
3. Uses a plain text file
4. Mobile friendly
5. Able to track / see DONE items

#### Gid does *just* that (and nothing else)!
1. Any PHP enabled webserver will do.
2. No need for third party tools, everything you need is here (Bootstrap and jQuery are included).
3. No database setup/connection necessary. Gid writes to a plaintext file that can be moved and editted by hand if needed (like todotxt.org).
4. Works and looks decent on a smartphone.
5. DONE items are still visible with a strikethrough.

#### Installation
Just drop/unpack the folder anywhere on your PHP server and you're pretty much good to go (check your file ownership and permissions).

#### Add shortcut to iPhone homescreen
Add the URL as a shortcut to your homescreen and it will present a nice looking icon.

#### 
Future features (maybe):
- Further todotxt.org file format support. Right now a done task will be written to a done.txt file with an 'x' and date.
